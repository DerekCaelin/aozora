## Submission 1

 > To facilitate healthy discourse between differing cultures by freely promoting corroborative facts across fair algorithms.

Despite billions of people using free Open Source tools, its values may not be obvious to all. In the face of ever growing monopolized social media addiction, an initiative like Bluesky is contrarian, and needs to be meaningfully articulated.

Doing what is right in a world that can only afford to say what is right, is controversy.

Our belief is to protect others from harm and oppression, to promote human rights and freedom for all. Our belief is to reduce the spread of violence, to cultivate an empowered space for independent thought and civil conversation.

While centralization is expedient, its abuses can create harm that far outweighs its potential gains. Therefore, preserving privacy endows every individual with freedom from authoritarianism, but such decentralization on its own does not lead to fairness. Fairness is the fusion of multi-cultural empathy and facts, what overlaps is constitutive, and what does not, is subjective.

Technology is a means towards this goal. It needs to be easy & accessible yet fast & small. Technology should create abundance, not scarcity.

Individuals, startups, non-profits, corporations and governments are welcome to use this work.

 ### Challenges

Even with unlimited funding, there are deep problems that get in the way of momentum.

 - **Accessibility is at odds with being Fast**. To be accessible, everything needs to work instantly out of any internet browser - but the web currently has severe performance problems. We're fixing this by upgrading the web, even though it may cause engineering delays.

 - **Small things are hard to be Easy**. To be easy, everything from the hardware to the software to the interface needs to be composable. Any one tiny piece of the stack that violates this can cause hair wrenching compatibility errors in places that become impossible to patch, making entire frameworks unusable or endlessly bloated. These problems become easier if developers adopt a phycisist-like mindset.

 - **Empowering one's freedom can conflict with preserving another's Privacy**. The ability to use any device anywhere in the world, online or offline, with the same local-first experience requires enormous battle testing. We should not inject rent-seeking centralized servers as a dependency. Yet scaling peer-to-peer connections globally without bottleneck, latency, or hiccup, while still being easy and accessible, is dauntlessly ambitious. But so was building aqueducts, roads, and pipes. We do this for our progeny because our grandparents did it for us, not the pyramid hell of one man's monument.

## Submission 2

To drive adoption of decentralized technologies that

  - enable users to communicate to others regardless of the ownership of the storage and network where the message may be stored, or where it originates

  - enable users to adopt a long-lived pseudnymous identity which only they can read messages directed to and write messages from; and to retain that identity regardless of the ownership of any particular domain name or storage mechanism

  - enable users to choose how they view the "feed" of messages, by using software or service providers of their choice
