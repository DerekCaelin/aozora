## Risks of a Decentralized Protocol
_document originally submitted to bluesky private discussion on Feb 24, 2020_

Attackers of an information network act like cancers and viruses of biological systems, but intelligently self-modifying.

It must be assumed that any network built will have formidable attackers and that any mechanisms we put in place for defense will themselves be exploited, and possibly subverted.

### Types of risks

Attackers will attempt to

- use the network to spread spam, disinformation, doxxing, directions for physical harm, and other maliciously intended content 
- in some cases, make the content spread virally to as many eyes as possible
- in some cases, display content only to selected users without making other users aware of it
- perform phishing attacks on selected individuals for the purposes of financial fraud
- slander, libel and embarrass individuals
- expose the identity of individuals and cause them to be physically harmed or subject to 'enforced disappearance' by secret police
- stir up hate against groups, possibly in languages not commonly used and targeted in geolocations that are a small minority of the population, with the intent of causing genocide

### Motivations of attackers

In order to understand the persistence of the attacks and the difficulties of governance mechanisms, it is important to list some possible motivations

- direct financial: well funded and coordinated phishing and spam attacks will generally continue only while they are profitable
  note that human labor is relatively inexpensive in many parts of the world so it must be assumed that both bot and human networks will be used in all coordinated attacks
  
- state sponsored: it is now a somewhat standard measure in authoritarian states to aggressively attempt to influence social media in favor of the individuals in power.  these attacks also have significant backing and may be backed by force of law in some geolocations (ie in certain countries criticizing the government is legally defined as 'terrorism').  Thus we need to assume some of the attacks above will be 'legally enforced' in certain jurisdictions (where the attack is legal, and the defense is not)

- attention getting: attention is itself a currency and some of the attacks are simply attempts to become more important or viral

- "religious" hate groups: organized groups with a religious type motivation (not necessarily an actual religion, but a shared belief in a need to remove certain other groups)

- individual vendettas

- financial/control/political: for various reasons it may be in the interest of certain powerful individuals or groups to slander others

It must be assumed that the attackers are organized outside the decentralized network and will come and go in coordinated fashion.

### Weak points

Attackers will enter at all points that allow them to, and in particular where they can apply leverage and/or gain control.

 - anonymized accounts that can be added quickly and can influence reputation/governance by becoming a majority
 - takeovers of existing influencer accounts
 - 'sleeper' accounts that are created ahead of time and behave normally for a certain period, with the intention of later using them to spread disinformation or take over governance
 - collusion between accounts to game any given system
 - developers themselves may be 'planted' by government entities (this actually occurred and resulted in an enforced disappearance of a twitter user in March 2018)
 - any way to influence the governance mechanism itself will be a particular focus of attack
 
* Note * we cannot count on Twitter to defend against these mechanisms.  Twitter itself as a corporate entity could be subject to takeover at some time in the future; Jack might not continue as CEO; the network should be built in such a way that if in some fairly short time in the future Twitter itself were taken over by a malicious entity, that it could still survive in some healthy fashion.
