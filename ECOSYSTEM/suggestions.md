The [Ecosystem Overview](https://gitlab.com/bluesky-community1/decentralized-ecosystem/-/blob/master/README.md)
will need to evolve over time, and there are also many smaller projects that may not belong there but deserve space in a larger view.

We have not yet decided exactly how to structure updates, but would like to collect suggestions and suggested additions here.

Please submit your suggestions as PRs to this doc - thanks
