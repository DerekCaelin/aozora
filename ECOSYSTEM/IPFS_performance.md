## Benefits of using IPFS in a decentralized public conversation

### How would we envision it being used? 
(would there be a content-hash of the entire message envelope?)
would it be used only for larger files such as video?


## Performance concerns
storage overhead

retrieval times

## Benchmarking

where are the benchmarks of IPFS performance?
