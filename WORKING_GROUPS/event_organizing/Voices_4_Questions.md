# Get out of my Feed!  Decentralized Reputation and Moderation

## Proposed Questions

1)  Define Blocking as : the blocked individual can neither see nor respond to my posts; I also cannot see or respond to their posts

    How can blocking be implemented in a decentralized public conversation?

2)  What is the role of trust (if any) in moderating a social network? Should decentralized social networks make use of trust, or should they be entirely trustless?

3)  How do connection rules impact conversations? For example, what are interactions like when users must mutually accept a linkage rather than being able to message anyone?

4) What social conventions exist in defederated systems to support the tasks of content moderation? Is there a role for technology to facilitate and extend them?
