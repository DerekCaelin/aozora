# Get out of my Feed!  Decentralized Reputation and Moderation

## Proposed Questions

1)  Define Blocking as : the blocked individual can neither see nor respond to my posts; I also cannot see or respond to their posts

    How can blocking be implemented in a decentralized public conversation?

2)  What is the role of trust (if any) in moderating a social network? Should decentralized social networks make use of trust, or should they be entirely trustless?
